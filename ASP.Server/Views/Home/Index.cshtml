        <p><U>Biography:</U></p>      
        <p>
            Henri René Albert Guy de Maupassant was a 19th-century French author, known as a master of the short story and representative of the naturalist school. He was a protégé of Gustave Flaubert, and his stories are characterized by an economy of style and effective endings. Many of his works are set during the Franco-Prussian War of the 1870s, describing the futility of war and the innocent civilians transformed by their experiences. He wrote 300 short stories, six novels, three travel books and a volume of verse, with "Boule de Suif" his most famous work.

        <p><U>Summary:</U></p>    
        <p>
            Friedrich Nietzsche's "Le gai savoir" was published in 1882, with a second edition in 1887 that added a fifth book, a preface and a poetic appendix. The work is mainly composed of aphorisms in which Nietzsche attempts to define the character of the human being and identify the ills from which "the European" suffers.

            Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was a German philosopher, known for starting his career as a classical philologist before turning to philosophy. He resigned from his university post in 1879 due to health problems, and continued to write his major works. In 1889, he suffered a mental collapse and lived out his final years under the care of his family, dying in 1900 from pneumonia and several strokes.
